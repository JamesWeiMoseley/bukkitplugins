Plugins are software add-on that are installed on a program to enhance its capabilities without changing the program itself. 

These plugins are for the game Minecraft.  It was written in Java and uses the Bukkit API, which is an API that provides their party developers with the ability to add their own code to Minecraft.  It then uses spigot as a build path as well as using their servers to run the game.  

Here are a number of plugins that allow players to fly, eat, throw grenades, plant flower bombs, etc in the survival mode of Minecraft.  Each folder has the source code all in one folder for easy readability, but all one has to do it download the jar file of his or her choice, and drop it into the plugins folder of their own server.  Finally to run the spigot server, the instructions are in the run txt file.  


To run your own server just download the minecraft package here:

Then download your preferred version of spigot:

Then drag your spigot file in the folder and opening it it should look like this.  And as you can see just drag the plugins to the plugin folder.  (Make sure to change false to true on the eula.txt file.
