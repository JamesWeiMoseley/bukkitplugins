Here are a number of plugins that allow players to fly, eat, throw grenades, plant flower bombs, etc in the survival mode of Minecraft.  Each folder has the source code all in one folder for easy readability. 
All you have to do it download the jar file of your choice, and drop it into the plugins folder of your own server.  
Finally to run the spigot server, the instructions are in the run txt file.

Plugins are software add-on that are installed on a program to enhance its capabilities without changing the program itself. 

These plugins are written in Java and uses the Bukkit API, which is an API that provides anyone with the ability to add their own code to Minecraft Java version. 
It then uses spigot as a build path as well as using their servers to run the game.  These specific plugins are optimized for Minecraft version 14.
